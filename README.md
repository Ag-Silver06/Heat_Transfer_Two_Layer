 Heat Transfer Analysis in Immiscible Fluids Flow Codes.
 
The codes provided serve as the basic skeleton for the study. The main objective is to investigate the effects of varying different parameters, such as the Grashof number (G) and the heat source parameter (B). In the paper, these parameters are systematically changed, and their influence on the system is analyzed.
